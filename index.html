                  <h4>GA4-240202501-AA1-EV03</h4>
                  <p>Hi!, my name is Dicmar Castro Dominguez and I am a student of Analysis and Development of Software
                     with ID 2898288.</p>
                  <p>
                     Welcome to my blog, where I showcase the progress I’ve made in mastering English as a second
                     language through videos, audios, and written texts. Here, you’ll find reflections on topics like
                     family, hobbies, work, travel, and current events. Each entry highlights how these experiences have
                     shaped my language skills and personal growth. This platform is a creative space where I combine
                     learning with real-life scenarios, illustrating how language opens doors to deeper understanding
                     and communication.</p>

                     Discovery at the Dawn of AI.</h5>

               </div>
               <p>
                  Fei-Fei Li, a figure in the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born in Beijing, China, she
                  developed a deep interest in AI early in life and pursued it passionately.
                  Her career took off at Stanford University, where she earned her Ph.D. and later joined as a
                  faculty member. It was here that she spearheaded revolutionary research in computer vision,
                  particularly focusing on image recognition and understanding. Her seminal work in developing
                  ImageNet, a vast database crucial for training
                  AI systems, became a cornerstone in the development of deep learning algorithms. Beyond academia,
                  Fei-Fei Li played a pivotal role in shaping AI policy and ethics. Recognizing the transformative
                  potential of AI, she advocated for responsible AI development, emphasizing the importance of
                  diversity and inclusion in technology. Her efforts led to the establishment of the Stanford
                  Human-Centered AI Institute, where interdisciplinary collaboration thrives under her guidance.
                  As her influence expanded globally, Li co-founded AI4ALL, a nonprofit organization dedicated to
                  increasing diversity and inclusion in AI education. Her commitment to democratizing AI education
                  has empowered countless young minds, especially women and underrepresented minorities, to pursue
                  careers in technology. Fei-Fei Li's
                  accolades are numerous, including being elected to the National Academy of Engineering and
                  receiving prestigious awards such as the Blavatnik National Award for Young Scientists. Her TED
                  talks and public appearances continue to inspire a new generation of AI enthusiasts worldwide.
                  Today, Fei-Fei Li's legacy endures not only through her technical contributions but also through
                  her advocacy for ethical AI practices and her dedication to ultivating a more inclusive AI
                  community. Her journey exemplifies a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a steadfast commitment to
                  harnessing technology for the betterment of humanity.

               <p>
                  Crime and punishment is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been the subject of much debate
                  throughout history. At its core, it involves the commission of a criminal act and the imposition of
                  punishment by the state in response. Crime and punishment systems vary widely from country to
                  country, but all have the goal of maintaining social order and protecting citizens from harm.
                  One of the key issues in crime and punishment is determining the appropriate punishment for a given
                  crime. Some argue for a system of punishment that is focused on rehabilitation, in which the
                  offender is given the opportunity to learn new skills and receive treatment for underlying problems
                  that may have contributed to their criminal behavior. Others argue for a system of punishment that
                  is focused on retribution, in which the offender is punished in proportion to the severity of their
                  crime as a way to deter others from committing similar crimes. Still, others argue that a system of
                  punishment should be focused on incapacitation, where the offender is removed from society so they
                  are unable to commit further crimes.
                  One of the most important aspect of crime and punishment is the process of how the criminal is
                  judged and punished. Fair Trial, Due process and access to legal representation are critical
                  components of the justice system. It allows the accused to defend themselves, prevent arbitrary or
                  discriminatory decisions and to ensure that the punishment fits the crime. Additionally, the use of
                  evidence-based methods to ensure the right people are being held accountable for their crime, in
                  order to improve the effectiveness of the punishment and reduce recidivism.
                  Furthermore, in recent years, the issue of mass incarceration has come to the forefront as a major
                  problem. Many argue that the current system of punishment is overly punitive and that the high rate
                  of incarceration in the United States and other countries is not only costly but also
                  disproportionately affects marginalized communities. This has led to calls for criminal justice
                  reform, with a focus on reducing the number of people incarcerated, and providing alternatives to
                  traditional forms of punishment, such as community supervision, treatment, and diversion programs.

               <h3>Critical Thinking and Media Literacy</h3>
               <h5 class="grey_font">October 13 2024</h5>
               <div class="col-md-6 img-float-right">

               <p>When we talk about media and information literacy we must mention that it seems to be necessary in
                  the formation of a citizenry capable of using information critically. The growing phenomena of
                  misinformation, as well as the effects of the media and especially social media on certain groups,
                  forces us to analyze how this type of education helps to create critical thinking.
                  Within the information and communication society, the development of information competence among
                  students is essential,
                  because it allows them to analyze and manage the information they receive from different sources.
                  This, together with the appearance of phenomena such as fake news and the development of
                  information and communication technologies (ICT), means that we have chosen this topic of study.
                  The research questions we have asked ourselves are the following: how information competence is
                  currently developing, what effects does a low development of this competence have and how does
                  critical thinking influence its development. To answer these questions, we have used the systematic
                  review as a methodology, analyzing a total of 17 articles extracted from the Web Of Science, SCOPUS
                  and Google Scholar databases. The conclusions reached establish that information competence is not
                  being developed adequately, due to aspects such as the lack of teacher training or the lack of
                  invested resources. This causes a change in methodology to be carried out. Furthermore, a low
                  development of this causes a series of negative effects, such as misinformation. It concludes by
                  establishing that critical thinking is one of the main elements that make up informational
                  competence, being necessary to achieve a correct development of this competence and a good
                  construction of knowledge among students.
